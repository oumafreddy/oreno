# Reports Privacy Fixes and Template Error Resolution

## Executive Summary

This document summarizes the fixes implemented to resolve template errors and enhance privacy by removing personal details (emails) from all report templates.

## Issues Resolved

### 1. Template Error: VariableDoesNotExist
**Error**: `Failed lookup for key [email] in None`
**Root Cause**: The template was trying to access `.email` attribute on null `assigned_by` and `assigned_to` fields
**Location**: `templates/reports/audit_engagement_details.html` line 54

### 2. Privacy Enhancement: Remove Personal Details
**Requirement**: No personal details (emails) should appear on reports
**Impact**: Enhanced privacy and data protection compliance

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Null Checks

#### Before (Error-Prone):
```html
<td>{{ engagement.assigned_by.get_full_name|default:engagement.assigned_by.email }}</td>
```

#### After (Safe):
```html
<td>{% if engagement.assigned_by %}{{ engagement.assigned_by.get_full_name|default:"Not specified" }}{% else %}Not specified{% endif %}</td>
```

### 2. Privacy-Enhanced User Display

#### Before (Showed Emails):
```html
<td>{{ issue.issue_owner.get_full_name|default:issue.issue_owner_email }}</td>
```

#### After (Names Only):
```html
<td>{% if issue.issue_owner %}{{ issue.issue_owner.get_full_name|default:"Not specified" }}{% else %}{{ issue.issue_owner_title|default:"Not specified" }}{% endif %}</td>
```
